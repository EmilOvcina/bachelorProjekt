        kml2geojson is a Python 3.4+ package to convert KML files to GeoJSON files.
        Most of its code is a translation into Python of the Node.js package `togeojson <https://github.com/mapbox/togeojson>`_, but kml2geojson also adds the following features.
        
        - Preserve KML object styling, such as color and opacity
        - Optionally write one JSON file cataloging all the KML styles used
        - Optionally create several GeoJSON files of FeatureCollections, one for each KML folder 
        
        
        Installation
        =============
        ``pip install kml2geojson``
        
        
        Usage
        ======
        At the command line type ``k2g --help`` for instructions.
        You can also use kml2geojson as a library.
        
        
        Documentation

        Notes
        ========
        - Development status: Alpha
        - This project uses semantic versioning (major.minor.micro), where each breaking feature or API change is considered a major change

        ===================
        If you want to help develop this project, here is some background reading.
        
        - The `KML reference <https://developers.google.com/kml/documentation/kmlreference?hl=en>`_ 
        - Python's `Minimal DOM implementation <https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/xml.dom.minidom.html>`_, which this project uses to parse KML files
        
        
        History
        ========
        
        4.0.2, 2017-04-26
        -------------------

        4.0.1, 2017-04-22
        -------------------
        - Stopped making FeatureCollections with top-level 'properties' attributes, because `RFC 7946 says that's not allowed <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7946#section-7>`_. Moved FeatureCollection names into a top-level 'name' attribute.
        - Stripped leading and trailing whitespace from text content to avoid cluttered or blank name and description attribute values
        - Switched to pytest for testing
