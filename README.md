# Improvement and Redesign of Web Interface in Connection with Drone Inspections

## Installer Version 
To install the virtual environment simply run the "unix_start.sh" file or "windows_start.bat" file depending on the operating system. Unix should work on Mac OS as well. 
Running the start script again afterwards does not install everything again, it checks if the virtual environment already is installed.

We have made cahnces to the file "limic/serve.py" and everything in the "leaflet" folder. To see which functions we have added in LiMiC, look for the "ADDED JONAS EMIL" comment in the file "limic/serve.py". Everyting in the "leaflet folder is our own code.

This version does NOT use pipenv to run LiMiC.
